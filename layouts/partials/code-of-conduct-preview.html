          satRday is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive
          conference experience for all in
          attendance regardless of, but not limited to, gender, sexual
          orientation, disabilities, physical
          attributes, age, ethnicity, social standing, religion or political
          affiliation.

          We do not tolerate harassment of participants (including organisers
          and vendors) in any form. Sexual
          innuendos and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue,
          including presentations.

          Anyone violating these rules may be given warning or expelled from the
          conference (without a refund)
          at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
