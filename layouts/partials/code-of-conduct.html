                <!-- <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2> -->

                <p>SatRdays is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate
                    harassment of
                    participants in any form.</p>

                <p>This code of conduct applies to all satRdays spaces, including meetups, Twitter, Slack, mailing
                    lists, both online
                    and offline. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these
                    spaces at the
                    discretion of the Global Leadership Team.</p>

                    <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person&rsquo;s lifestyle choices and practices, including those

                    <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of &lsquo;dead&rsquo; or rejected names.</li>
                    <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they&rsquo;re not
                        appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like &ldquo;hug&rdquo;
                        or
                        &ldquo;backrub&rdquo;) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
                    <li>Threats of violence.</li>
                    <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide

                    <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>SatRdays prioritizes marginalized people&rsquo;s safety over privileged people&rsquo;s comfort. The
                    Global
                    Leadership Team will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>&lsquo;Reverse&rsquo; -isms, including &lsquo;reverse racism,&rsquo; &lsquo;reverse
                        sexism,&rsquo; and
                        &lsquo;cisphobia&rsquo;.</li>
                    <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as &ldquo;leave me alone,&rdquo; &ldquo;go
                        away,&rdquo; or
                        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not discussing this with you.&rdquo;</li>
                    <li>Communicating in a &lsquo;tone&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t find congenial.</li>
                    <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>

                <p>If you are being harassed by a member/guest/participant of/at satRdays, notice that someone else is
                    being harassed,
                    or have any other concerns, please contact the Code of Conduct committee of the current event via <a
                        href="mailto://coc.satrday.berlin@gmail.com">coc.satrday.berlin@gmail.com</a>
                    or the Global Leadership Team via <a
                        href="mailto://leadership@satrdays.org">leadership@satrdays.org</a>.
                    Local incidences will be handled together with the local organisers. If the person who is harassing
                    you is on the
                    team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we
                    can.
                </p>

                <p>You also can write anonymous report <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/eZKUZSleYa6ysxOH2">here</a>.</p>

                <p>This code of conduct applies to satRdays spaces, but if you are being harassed by a
                    member/guest/participant of/at
                    satRdays outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of
                    harassment by
                    satRdays members, especially the Global Leadership Team, seriously. This includes harassment outside
                    our spaces and
                    harassment that took place at any point in time. The Global Leadership Team reserves the right to
                    exclude people
                    from satRdays based on their past behavior, including behavior outside satRdays spaces and behavior
                    towards people
                    who are not part of satRdays.</p>

                <p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we
                    believe to have
                    been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without
                    response.</p>

                <p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our
                    discretion, we may
                    publicly name a person about whom we&rsquo;ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn
                    third parties about
                    them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of satRdays members or the general
                    public. We will not
                    name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

                <h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

                <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

                <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Global Leadership Team may take any action they
                    deem
                    appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all satRdays spaces and identification of the
                    participant as a
                    harasser to other satRdays members or the general public.</p>
